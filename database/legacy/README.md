Legacy databases, FASTA files from earlier in the THAPBI Phyto-Threats
project.

File ``database.fasta`` was originally checked into the GitHub repository
https://github.com/widdowquinn/THAPBI-pycits/ ago on 24 October 2016 as the
following commit:

https://github.com/widdowquinn/THAPBI-pycits/commit/05502ddb15b7172c58f495d7df81f244e540925c

This is a FASTA file of 153 sequences, ranging in length from 163bp to 838bp
(i.e. some are much longer than the core ITS1 region of our interest).

Peter Cock understands this dataset was originally compiled by Santiago Garcia
(Forest Research).

The entry names like ``1Phytophthora_infestans_CBS36651`` take the format of
the clade name (here ``1``), species (here *Phytophthora infestans*) and an
identifier (here voucher number ``CBS36651`` whose 795bp nucleotide sequence
is available on the NCBI as accession ``HQ643247.1``).
