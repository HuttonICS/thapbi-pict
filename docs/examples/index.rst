Worked Examples
===============

While THAPBI PICT stands for *Phytophthora* ITS1 Classification Tool, with
appropriate primer settings and a custom database, it can be applied to other
organisms and/or barcode marker sequences.

These worked examples using public datasets from published papers include
oomycetes, fungi, microalgae, and cover markers in ITS1, ITS2 and 18S rRNA.

   recycled_water/index
   fungal_mock/index
   microalgal_mock/index

For each worked example there is a different sub-folder in the THAPBI PICT
source code under ``examples/`` containing ``setup.sh`` to download the public
data, ``run.sh`` to execute the main analysis discussed, and assorted other
files like ``metadata.tsv``.
