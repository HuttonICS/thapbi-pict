Worked Examples
===============

While THAPBI PICT stands for *Phytophthora* ITS1 Classification Tool, with
appropriate primer settings and a custom database, it can be applied to other
organisms and/or barcode marker sequences.

These worked examples using public datasets from published papers include
oomycetes, fungi, microalgae, and cover markers in ITS1, ITS2 and 18S rRNA.
